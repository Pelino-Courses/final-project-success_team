# Mobile Applications Development : Final Project

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to develop a mobile application using Flutter based on a provided Figma design. The application will consist of 5 screens. Each team member will be responsible for designing and implementing the logic of the app.

## Teams
This assignment will be completed in teams of 5. Each team member will be responsible for one screen of the application.

## Design
The design of the application can be found [Here](https://www.figma.com/file/wadC89Pj6fm6VRDLxPpJbz/UI?type=design&node-id=7%3A204&mode=design&t=c0ECgKW4IufRE1xh-1). Each team member is expected to replicate the design of their assigned screen as closely as possible(But feel free to change the app theme if you want).

## Implementation
Each team member will be responsible for both the design and the logic of their assigned screen. This includes creating the UI in Flutter and implementing any necessary functionality.

## Collaboration
All work will be done collaboratively using GitHub. Each team member will create their own branch for their screen and will merge their changes into the main branch upon completion.

## Submission
The final project will be submitted via GitHub Classroom. Each team will submit a single repository containing the complete application. The repository should include a README file with the following information:

- A brief description of the application
- The names of all team members and the screen they were responsible for
- Instructions for running the application

## Grading
The project will be graded on the following criteria:

- Accuracy of the design implementation
- Functionality of the application
- Collaboration and use of Git
- Quality of the code
- Completeness of the README file

## Due Date
The final project is due on [25 January 2024]. Late submissions will not be accepted.

Good luck & Happy coding!
