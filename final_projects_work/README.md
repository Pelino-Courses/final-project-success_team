this TECH_ME application we have done on is composed of 5 screens which start from 
SPLASH_SCREEN
LOGIN_SCREEN
REGISTRATION_SCREEN
OTP_VERIFIFCATION
PASSWORD_RECOVER
as it is listed respectively.

any user who have already joined this application has to start from splash screen by clicking on join_button  which will move him/her directly to login_screen and after entering all the necessary details this will take him/her
to the otp_verification screen and finally click submit button to gain full access on this application 

 and if you are a new user you will directly click on the sign_up and fill all the necessary details  after it will take you back to login_sreen through pressing login here button and then follow the previous steps and after the user will be able to use the application as required.

 if you forget password ,you pass through login_screen and then click forgot password button to direct you to the password recover screen so at that time you will be able to reset your password.
